## About Me

<img src="img/mypic.jpeg" alt="mypic" width="140" align="right"/><br/>
I'm an Ph.D. student at UT-Austin advised by Professors [Işıl Dillig](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~isil/) and [Swarat Chaudhuri](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~swarat/). I completed my undergrad at USC, where I worked with Professors [Joseph Lim](https://clvrai.com/web_lim/) at USC and [Shaohua Sun](https://shaohua0116.github.io/) now at National Taiwan University.

## Research

I'm interested in program synthesis and general tasks that reqires models to reason.

## Research Projects

- **Program Synthesis through Contrastive Learning on Auxiliary Data (On-going)**
  
  This project tries to learn a program synthesis model by taking advantage of auxiliary data from each task (e.g. flow chart of program, examples of failed programs). We aim to develop a contrastive learning method to create a joint embedding space for all types of data, which is used for downstream tasks.

- **Hierarchical Framework for Program Synthesis (On-going)**
  
  In this work, we present a program synthesis framework that synthesizes a program by hierarchically composing sub-programs. This way we can build scalable program synthesis models to generate long programs with complex behaviors.

- **Policy Transfer across Visual and Dynamics Domain Gaps**
  
  This project aims to transfer robotics policy from a training environment to a target environment where domain gap exists both visually (e.g. lighting, viewpoint, clutter, and background) and dynamically (e.g. the mass of objects and calibration of the robot).

## Misc 

- [I Will Not Make Any More Boring Art](https://github.com/thoughtp0lice/i_will_not_make_any_more_boring_art)
  
  A python implementation of modern art work [I Will Not Make Any More Boring Art](https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/john-baldessari-i-will-not-make-any-more-boring-art-1971/) by John Baldessari.
- [Technicolor Filter](https://github.com/thoughtp0lice/technicolor_filter)
  
  This package try to recreate the process of technicolor filming and allows you to use different shades of cyan, magenta, and yellow to edit your own picture like the film makers in old Hollywood.

- [Han and the Telescreen](https://thoughtp0lice.github.io/my_blog/)

  A blog that I wrote for a writing class from September to December 2022. I mainly covered trending tech news during that time.
